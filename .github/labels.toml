# These labels are derived from the default Github names and colors,
# augmented with:
#   * More details for triage states
#   * Tags for platform specific issues
#
# To sync these labels with a repository
# 1. Generate a Github Access Token
# 2. Export a LABELS_USERNAME and LABELS_TOKEN environment variable
# 3. Install `labels` from PyPI:
#
#      pip install labels
#
# 4. cd into the .github folder where the labels.toml file is stored
# 5. Perform a dry run for a specific repo (say beeware/toga):
#
#      labels sync -n -o beeware -r toga
#
#    Audit the changes that will be made
#
# 6. Run the update:
#
#      labels sync -o beeware -r toga
