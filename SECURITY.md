# Security Policy

The BeeWare Projects team is strongly committed to responsible reporting and
disclosure of security-related issues. As such, we’ve adopted and follow a set
of policies which conform to that ideal and are geared toward allowing us to
deliver timely security updates to the official distribution of BeeWare tools,
as well as to third-party distributions.

## Reporting security issues

Short version: please report security issues by emailing
[security@beeware.org](mailto:security@beeware.org).

Most normal bugs in BeeWare are reported to our public Github issue trackers,
but due to the sensitive nature of security issues, we ask that they not be
publicly reported in this fashion.

Instead, if you believe you’ve found something in BeeWare which has security
implications, please send a description of the issue via email to
[security@beeware.org](mailto:security@beeware.org). Mail sent to that address
reaches the security team.

Once you’ve submitted an issue via email, you should receive an acknowledgment
from a member of the security team within 48 hours, and depending on the action
to be taken, you may receive further followup emails.

## Supported versions

At present, the BeeWare team is only committed to providing security updates
to the most recently released versions of our tools.
